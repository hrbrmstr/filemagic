Title: Retrieve 'Magic' Attributes from Files and Directories
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2016-08-14
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr), Christos Zoulas [libmagic], Mans Rullgard [file]
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rud.is>
Description: The 'libmagic' library provides functions to determine
    'MIME' type and other metadata from files through their "magic"
    attributes. This is useful when you do not wish to rely solely on
    the honesty of a user or the extension on a file name.
